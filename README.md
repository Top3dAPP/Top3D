# Top3d
Top3d is an efficient and compact Matlab code to solve three-dimensional topology optimization problems. The 169 lines comprising this code include finite element analysis, sensitivity analysis, density filter, optimality criterion optimizer, and display of results. The basic code solves minimum compliance problems. A systematic approach is presented to easily modify the denition of supports and external loads.

## Quick Start
Save the program [top3d.m](top3d.m) and start MATLAB in the same directory. The program can be promoted by line
`top3d(30,10,2,0.5,3.0,1.2)`
